  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Techonology</strong></li>
    <p>Being a technocrat, I love to know about the technologies coming in and how the things or stuffs work.</p>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuQve7R140c">Teaching</a></strong></li>
    <p>It's well said: <em>knowledge is something that should flow.</em> I love teaching; because that's the only way
      I can impart my hard earned knowledge to others.</p>
    <li><strong>Travelling</strong></li>
    <p>I love to travel across the country; visiting places with different culture, language and life-style.
    This is the source of my observation and generation of view point of my life and its aim. </p>
